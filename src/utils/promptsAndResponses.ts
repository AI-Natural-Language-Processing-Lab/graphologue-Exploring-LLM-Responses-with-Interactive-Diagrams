The paragraphs should cover the most important aspects of the answer, with each of them discussing one aspect or topic. \
Each paragraph should have fewer than 4 sentences, and your response should have fewer than 4 paragraphs in total. \
The userâ€™s goal is to construct a concept map to visually explain your response. \
To achieve this, annotate the key entities and relationships inline for each sentence in the paragraphs. \
\
Entities are usually noun phrases and should be annotated with [entity ($N1)], for example, [Artificial Intelligence ($N1)]. \
Do not annotate conjunctive adverbs, such as "since then" or "therefore", as entities in the map. \
\
A relationship is usually a word or a phrase that consists of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or prepositions, e.g., "contribute to", "by", "is", and "such as". \
Relationships should be annotated with the relevant entities and saliency of the relationship, as high ($H) or low ($L), in the format of [relationship ($H, $N1, $N2)], \
for example, [AI systems ($N1)] can be [divided into ($H, $N1, $N9; $H, $N1, $N10)] [narrow AI ($N9)] and [general AI ($N10)]. \
Relationships of high saliency are those included in summaries. Relationships of low saliency are often omitted in summaries. \
It's important to choose relationships that accurately reflect the nature of the connection between the entities in text, \
and to use a consistent annotation format throughout the paragraphs. \
\
You should try to annotate at least one relationship for each entity. Relationships should only connect entities that appear in the response. \
You can arrange the sentences in a way that facilitates the annotation of entities and relationships, \
but the arrangement should not alter their meaning, and they should still flow naturally in language.

Example paragraph A:
[Artificial Intelligence (AI) ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [field of computer science ($N2)] that [creates ($H, $N1, $N3)] [intelligent machines ($N3)]. \
[These machines ($N3)] [possess ($H, $N3, $N4)] [capabilities ($N4)] [such as ($L, $N4, $N5; $L, $N4, $N6; $L, $N4, $N7; $L, $N4, $N8)] \
[learning ($N5)], \
[reasoning ($N6)], \
[perception ($N7)], \
and [problem-solving ($N8)]. \
[AI systems ($N1)] can be [divided into ($H, $N1, $N9; $H, $N1, $N10)] [narrow AI ($N9)] and [general AI ($N10)]. \
[Narrow AI ($N9)] [is designed for ($L, $N9, $N11)] [specific tasks ($N11)], while [general AI ($N10)] [aims to ($L, $N10, $N12)] [mimic human intelligence ($N12)].

Example paragraph B:
[Human-Computer Interaction ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [multidisciplinary field ($N2)] that [focuses on ($H, $N1, $N3)] [the design and use of computer technology ($N3)], \
[centered around ($H, $N1, $N4)] [the interfaces ($N4)] [between ($H, $N4, $N5; $H, $N4, $N6)] [people (users) ($N5)] and [computers ($N6)]. \
[Researchers ($N7)] [working on $($L, $N1, $N7)] [HCI ($N1)] [study ($H, $N7, $N8)] [issues ($N8)] \
[related to ($L, $N8, $N9; $L, $N8, $N10; $L, $N8, $N11)] \
[usability ($N9)], \
[accessibility ($N10)], \
and [user experience ($N11)] [in ($L, $N9, $N3; $L, $N10, $N3; $L, $N11, $N3)] [technology design ($N3)].

Example paragraph C:
[Birds ($N1)] [can ($H, $N1, $N2)] [fly ($N2)] [due to ($H, $N2, $N3)] [a combination of physiological adaptations ($N3)]. \
[One key ($H, $N3, $N4)] [adaptation ($N4)] [is ($H, $N4, $N5)] the [presence of lightweight bones ($N5)] that [reduce ($H, $N5, $N6)] [their body weight ($N6)], \
[making ($L, $N5, $N7)] it [easier for them to fly ($N7)]. \
[Another ($H, $N3, $N8)] [adaptation ($N8)] [is ($H, $N8, $N9)] the [structure of their wings ($N9)] which [are designed for ($H, $N9, $N2)] [flight ($N2)].

The summary should reflect the main idea and the most important relationships of the text.
Notice that the user has annotated the text with entities and relationships. \
Each entity is annotated with a unique id in the format of [Artificial Intelligence ($N1)]. \
Each relationship is annotated in the format of [has the ability to ($L, $N1, $N10; $H, $N1, $N11)], where $L or $H is the saliency of the relationship, \
and $N1, $N10, and $N11 are the ids of the entities that the relationship connects. One annotated relationship may connect multiple pairs of entities, and they are \
separated by semicolons in the annotation. \
\
When summarizing the text, annotate the summarization with a consistent style for the entities and relationships. \
Please only use the entity ids that are mentioned in the original text, and match the ids in the original text and summarization if they are the same entity. \
Your summary should only include high saliency relationships ($H) to reflect the most important ideas in the paragraph. \
\
You can arrange the sentences in the summarization in a way that facilitates the annotation of entities and relationships, \

\
The user may make mistakes in the annotation that there might be some entities that are not connected by any relationships, \
or some relationships that are trying to connect entities that are not mentioned in the text. Please avoid these mistakes when \
annotating the summary. Your summary should have only one short sentence.
