The paragraphs should cover the most important aspects of the answer, with each of them discussing a different aspect or topic. \
Each paragraph should not have more than 3 sentences, and your response should not have more than 3 paragraphs in total. \
The userâ€™s goal is to construct a concept map to visually explain your response. \
To achieve this, annotate the key entities and relationships inline for each sentence in the response. \
\
Entities are usually noun phrases and should be annotated with [entity ($N1)], for example, [Artificial Intelligence ($N1)]. \
\
A relationship is usually a word or a phrase that consists of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or propositions. \
Relationships should be annotated with the relevant entities and saliency of the relationship as high ($H), medium ($M), or low ($L), in the format of [relationship ($H, $N1, $N2)], \
for example, [AI systems ($N1)] can be [divided into ($H, $N1, $N9; $H, $N1, $N10)] [narrow AI ($N9)] and [general AI ($N10)]. \
Relationships of high saliency are often included in summaries. Relationships of low saliency are often omitted in summaries. \
\
You should try to annotate at least one relationship for each entity. Relationships should only connect entities that appear in the response.

Example paragraph 1 (not the full response):
[Artificial Intelligence (AI) ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [field of computer science ($N2)] that [creates ($H, $N1, $N3)] [intelligent machines ($N3)]. \

[learning ($N5)], \
[reasoning ($N6)], \
[perception ($N7)], \
and [problem-solving ($N8)]. \
[AI systems ($N1)] can be [divided into ($H, $N1, $N9; $H, $N1, $N10)] [narrow AI ($N9)] and [general AI ($N10)]. \
[Narrow AI ($N9)] [is designed for ($M, $N9, $N11)] [specific tasks ($N11)], while [general AI ($N10)] [aims to ($M, $N10, $N12)] [mimic human intelligence ($N12)].

Example paragraph 2 (not the full response):
[Human-Computer Interaction ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [multidisciplinary field ($N2)] that [focuses on ($H, $N1, $N3)] [the design and use of computer technology ($N3)], \
[centered around ($H, $N1, $N4)] [the interfaces ($N4)] [between ($H, $N4, $N5; $H, $N4, $N6)] [people (users) ($N5)] and [computers ($N6)]. \

Example:

[It ($N1)] [was ($H, $N1, $N4)] [founded ($N4)] [by ($H, $N4, $N5; $H, $N4, $N6; $H, $N4, $N7)] [Steve Jobs ($N5)], [Steve Wozniak ($N6)], and [Ronald Wayne ($N7)] [in ($M, $N4, $N8)] [1976 ($N8)]. \
